This is the page for the paper "A reinforcement learning guided hybrid evolutionary algorithm for the latency location routing problem". The instances referenced in the paper can be downloaded from http://prodhonc.free.fr/. The maximum number of vehicles for each instance is determined based on the findings presented in Vincent, F. Y., Lin, S. W., Lee, W., & Ting, C. J. (2010). A simulated annealing heuristic for the capacitated location routing problem. Computers & Industrial Engineering, 58(2), 288-299. These values can also be found in the appendix tables of our paper.
